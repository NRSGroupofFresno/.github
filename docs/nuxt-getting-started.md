# Nuxt.js Getting Started Guide

## Introduction

Nuxt's goal is to make web development intuitive and performant with a great Developer Experience in mind.

## Configuration

Nuxt is configured with sensible defaults to make you productive.

## Development Server

Now you'll be able to start your Nuxt app in development mode:

### npm

```bash
npm run dev -- -o
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn dev --open
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm dev -o
```

### bun

```bash
bun run dev -o
```

### deno

```bash
deno task dev
```

Well done! A browser window should automatically open for http://localhost:3000.

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your Nuxt project, you are ready to start building your application.
